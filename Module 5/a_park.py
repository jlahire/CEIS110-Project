'''
The following (unfinished) program implements a digital 
line queuing system for an amusement park ride. The system 
allows a rider to reserve a place in line without actually 
having to wait. The rider simply enters a name into a 
program to reserve a place. Riders that purchase a VIP pass 
get to skip past the common riders up to the last VIP rider 
in line. VIPs board the ride first. (Considering the average 
wait time for a Disneyland ride is about 45 minutes, this 
might be a useful program.) For this system, an employee 
manually selects when the ride is dispatched (thus removing 
the next riders from the front of the line).

Complete the following program, as described above. Once 
finished, add the following commands:

The rider can enter a name to find the current position in 
line. (Hint: Use the list.index() method.)
The rider can enter a name to remove the rider from the line.
